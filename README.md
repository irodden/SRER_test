# SRER_test
test data and code using SRER
SRER_speciescover.R attempts to group all of the species in the Santa Rita Experimental Range monitoring dataset by the total number of occurrences of that species for each year. 
It is intended to provide a gross sense of the dominance of each plant species on the range over entire area and length of time. It currently does not account for variation between
transects or over time.
The individual year calculations can probably be better handled with some kind of function.
SRER_exclosure_cover.R is similar to above but using a more limited dataset.
